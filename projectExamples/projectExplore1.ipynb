      "old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked \n",
      "the Professor at her but she kept on \n",
      "coming. So had to hit her with this \n",
      "purse I found. Ah, the point is it's \n",
      "Morgan's fault. That pencil pushing \n",
      "scazwag.  Why if she were here I'd - \n",
      "Uh oh is she behind me?\n",
      "No. I'm in front of you!\n",
      "Morgan? It's 3am.\n",

      "you.  My God, it's so...repulsive.  \n",
      "So uh, this is where you eat?\n",
      "Eat and sleep.\n",
      "Oh Fry!\n",
      "Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could \n",
      "be back any second.\n",
      "Not likely. I ordered him to flush out \n",

      "Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - \n",
      "What the?  Oh now I see! Now I get \n",
      "it. Now the pieces are falling into \n",
      "place. The office, the promotion, that \n",
      "dwarf in my book club who steals my \n",
      "opinions.  It's all coming together \n",

      "Mr Bender about last night. that was \n",
      "just a...a misunderstanding.\n",
      "Oh you didn't understand? Well let me \n",
      "explain. You......were having sex with \n",
      "you.\n",
      "No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank \n",
      "isn't supposed to fraternize.\n",
      "That's what makes it so juicy. Its the \n",

      "\"It was lovable......old Bender.\"\n",
      "Hey, what did you do to him?\n",
      "I downloaded his brain. Everything that \n",

      "memories, his in-your-face interface.\n",
      "But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart \n",
      "making!  What did you do now? Stop doing \n",
      "things!\n",
      "I sent the disk to be filed at the Central \n",
      "Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do \n",
      "Fry. He was a bad robot.\n",
      "No, he was a bad friend. I want him \n",
      "back right now.\n",
      "Then you should have filed a request \n",
      "20 years ago.\n",
      "I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.\n",
      "Dirty boy! Dirty boy!\n",
      "You and Morgan were having an affair?\n",
      "I couldn't help it. She loved me because \n",
      "of the part of me that's a slob and \n",
      "I loved her because of the part of me \n",
      "that's desperate.\n",
      "Poor Bender. Without his brain he's \n",
      "become all quiet and helpful. We've \n",
      "got to go to the Central Bureaucracy \n",
      "and get that disk back!\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Oh yes we must, yes.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Well, those arguments aside, we're still \n",
      "going.\n",
      "You can't just waltz into the Central \n",
      "Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red \n",

      "but a friend of mine went completely \n",
      "mad trying to find the washroom there.\n",
      "Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's \n",
      "been there before.\n",
      "Oh I've been there. Lot's of times!\n",
      "Look at that. The carts go out full \n",
      "but they come in empty. It's criminally \n",
      "inefficient.\n",
      "But don't you see? They could increase \n",
      "efficiency 4% if they used the empty \n",
      "carts to haul in heavy mining machinery.\n",
      "Oh Lord!\n",
      "Man, how long is this gonna take?\n",
      "I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.\n",
      "Well it doesn't look like I'll make \n",
      "it inside with the rest of you. Uh but \n",
      "good luck. Just leave me where I drop.\n",
      "Oh great, someone had a baby!\n",
      "Come on, I have a better idea.\n",
      "Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express \n",

      "No! You have too much to live for. It \n",

      "I could?\n",

      "Well, I don't remember any of that but \n",
      "I don't have the wherewithal to defend \n",
      "myself.\n",
      "Then I have no choice but to charge \n",

      "There you go.\n",
      " What have I done?!\n",

      "It is...acceptable.\n",
      "Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. \n",
      "Why'd you stop eating master?\n",
      " Because...my stomach is about \n",
      "to explode.\n",
      "What? My dinner killed you? Oh man!\n",
      " Oh it hurts. But don't lose \n",
      "confidence. The important thing is that \n",
      "you defeat Elzar after I am gone.  And \n",
      "using this, you cannot fail.\n",
      "A diamond vial of Mrs Dash?\n",
      " No, it is the essence of pure \n",

      "forth.  Oh! There goes my...life.\n",
      "I'll avenge you master. I swear, in \n",

      "that I shall defeat Elzar!\n",
      "Oh I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill! \n",

      "Why you -\n",
      "Helmut Spargle has a message for you. \n",
      "He says  \"Ooo, I'm dead!\"\n",
      "Spargle huh? What he do, bland himself \n",
      "to death?\n",
      "No. He was eating some food I made and \n",
      "by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. \n",
      "Now I'm here to avenge him.\n",
      "OK but it seems like you're the one \n",
      "who killed him.\n",
      "Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. \n",

      "Besides, Guenter, you're not like other \n",

      "The jungle. But I couldn't do that to \n",

      " Oh, poor Guenter.\n",
      "So he just ran away in the middle of \n",
      "the exam?\n",
      "I'm afraid so. All he handed in was \n",
      "a paper smeared with faeces. He tied \n",
      "with Fry.\n",
      "I guess he realised I was right when \n",
      "I told him to go back to the jungle.\n",
      "You what? After I spent months slaving \n",
      "over a hot monkey brain?\n",
      "Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force \n",
      "Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. \n",
      "He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus \n",
      "on one of those tiny tricycles. Now \n",
      "that's entertainment.\n",
      "But Guenter's obviously better off being \n",
      "intelligent. Tell him, Leela.\n",
      "Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now \n",
      "here's my opinion: What we should do \n",

      "What?\n",
      "I said we'll go to the jungle and let \n",
      "Guenter decide once and for all.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "You all know the rules. Whichever house \n",
      "wins the regatta becomes head of the \n",
      "Greek Council. And should that house \n",
      "currently be on any type of multiple \n",

      "There's our man!\n",
      "Professor, you'll offer Guenter the \n",

      "We'll let him choose whether he wants \n",
      "to be intelligent or just a mindless \n",
      "animal.\n",
      "Come on, Guenter, take the hat.\n",
      "No, the banana, the banana!\n",

      "Kif might.\n",
      "Leela, who are you talking to?\n",
      "Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. \n",
      "And his commanding officer.\n",
      "Why, you're that disgraced starship \n",

      "Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. \n",
      "Anyway, whoever you all are, I have \n",

      "under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy.\n",

      "is she?\n",
      "She's really strict.\n",
      "And mean.\n",
      "I see. Does she by any chance give the \n",
      "crewmembers spankings?\n",
      "No, she just makes us do work and stuff.\n",
      "Good, good. But should she ever institute \n",
      "some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy \n",
      "let me go in your place. I won't have \n",
      "my comrades harmed.\n",
      "Hey, this guy's alright!\n",
      "Here's to us poor schmoes working for \n",

      "I've computed out landing co-ordinates, \n",
      "Captain.\n",
      "Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.\n",
      "Wait, what?\n",
      "I said \"very nice work\".\n",
      "This is the happiest day of my life.\n",
      "OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to \n",
      "delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.\n",
      "They're not very heavy but you don't \n",
      "hear me not complaining.\n",
      "They're not heavy in here because we \n",
      "have an anti-grav pump. But once you \n",
      "get out on the surface the gravity will \n",
      "be very intense.\n",
      "Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect \n",
      "me.\n",
      "I don't want any screw-ups. Use the \n",
      "hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow \n",
      "at a time.\n",
      "Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all \n",
      "the pillows at once.\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "That's using the old noodle!\n",
      "Come on, girdle. Hold!\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "What the hell happened?\n",
      "Some breaking occured, the dolly was \n",
      "involved, that's about all we know.\n",
      "I told you dumb apes not to overload \n",
      "it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs \n",
      "here.\n",
      "Alright, don't get your panties in a \n",
      "knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.\n",
      "I'll start loading up the pillows.\n",
      "No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, \n",
      "so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows \n",
      "by hand.\n",
      "Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: \n",
      "Does the company that made your bra \n",
      "make a girdle as well? I ask because \n",
      "a friend of mine--\n",
      "Just get to work.\n",
      " I'm Leela, get to work, neh \n",
      "neh neh.\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "The point is, it's just so humiliating \n",
      "working for that man. Once, he actually \n",
      "ordered me to ... shave his armpits \n",
      "while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--\n",
      "Y'know, why don't we talk about something \n",
      "besides Zapp for a while?\n",
      "Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout \n",
      "then, um...OK, well, there he was in \n",
      "the tub, alright?\n",
      "Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. \n",
      "That'll cool us off.\n",
      "This is all Leela's fault.\n",
      "Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up \n",
      "dolly, we could have broken it, given \n",
      "up and gone home by now.\n",
      "Y'know boys, a good captain needs many \n",
      "skills, such as boldness, daring and \n",
      "a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced \n",
      "Leela has any of those things.\n",
      "Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish \n",
      "she didn't make us work so much.\n",
      "Back when I was captain all I asked \n",
      "from my men was their complete loyalty. \n",
      "If I had that, then for all I cared \n",
      "they could sit around the whole day \n",
      "drinking beer in their underpants.\n",
      "Beer?\n",
      "Underpants?\n",
      "But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. \n",
      "I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually \n",
      "laughing!\n",
      "This is a mutiny.\n",

      "to save you.  Damn, it's too small. \n",
      "What did those human design this for \n",
      "anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! \n",
      "See you on the other side!\n",
      "Bender? Bender?!\n",

      "Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? \n",
      "Who's he gonna flush next?\n",
      "Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed \n",

      "You're right. I feel terrible.\n",
      "Oh, great, now you're making him feel \n",
      "worse!\n",
      "I guess we'd better go down into the \n",

      "There's no such thing as mutants. That's \n",

      "I burned my finger.\n",
      "OK, check the guidebook.\n",
      "Looks like we're under Park Avenue. \n",
      "Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was \n",
      "probably once a charity luncheon for \n",
      "the Met.\n",
      "Wait, what's that?\n",
      "I never should have thrown out the manual.\n",
      "Bender, you didn't have to come down \n",
      "here.\n",
      "I know. But I just missed Nibbler so \n",
      "much.\n",
      " He was so cute.\n",
      " He was so sweet.\n",
      "Eck! This emotional display is making \n",

      "that is.\n",
      " Nibbler?\n",
      " Nibbler?\n",
      "It's no use. We'd better turn back. \n",
      "Which way, Fry?\n",
      "Hmm. According to this map, the only \n",
      "way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't \n",
      "worry. It gets wider after about a mile.\n",
      " Idiot.\n",
      " Idiot.\n",
      "OK, OK, nevermind. I'll just ask those \n",

      "It must be wonderful.\n",
      "Eh.\n",
      "Listen. We actually came down here to \n",

      "down the toilet.\n",
      "Well if he got flushed down the toilet \n",

      " Nibbler?\n",
      " Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.\n",
      "So, is it true that alligators flushed \n",
      "down the toilet survive down here?\n",
      "No. That's just an urban legend.\n",
      "Then what are those?\n",
      "Crocodiles.\n",
      "We keep them as pets. Then, when they \n",

      "Bender, do something.\n",
      "I'm too scared.\n",

      "As a friend.\n",

      "How badly?\n",
      "That's it over there.  Don't worry, \n",

      "for a minute?  In private?\n",
      "Oh, no problem.\n",
      "This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's \n",

      "stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will \n",
      "you be my date, please?\n",

      "ashamed to tell you about it.\n",
      "Bender's in his office.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual \n",
      "fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's \n",
      "you, I'll need it in advance.\n",
      "OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.\n",
      "Why exactly did you shave your legs \n",
      "anyway? Are you expecting something \n",
      "to happen with your Valentine's date?\n",
      "What business is it of yours?\n",
      "And another thing: You're using an awful \n",

      "This is deodorant.\n",
      "What does it do?\n",

      "I'm a banking industry regulator.\n",
      "Really? Y'know I heard that banking \n",
      "industry regulations are really very \n",
      "simple.\n",
      "Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern \n",
      "banking regulations are a product of \n",

      "Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!\n",
      "Leela, what have you done?\n",

      "Now now, perfectly symmetrical violence \n",
      "never solved anything.\n",
      "Let's recap what's happened so far. \n",
      "As you can see I accidentally created \n",
      "a box containing your universe.\n",
      "While I, in a simultaineous blunder \n",
      "created a box containing your universe.\n",
      "This is getting confusing. Why don't \n",
      "we call our universe \"Universe A\" and \n",
      "this universe \"Universe B\"?\n",
      "Hey, why can't we be universe A?\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "We want the best letter!\n",
      "We called it first. Besides, this place \n",
      "kinda feels like a \"B\" y'know?\n",
      "Alright, you can be crummy universe \n",
      "A. And we'll be universe 1!\n",
      "Or \"The Mongooses,\" that's a cool team \n",
      "name. The Fighting Mongooses!\n",
      "Wait a minute. If our universes are \n",
      "identical then why did our Leela look \n",
      "into the box and your Leela didn't?\n",
      "Well to be honest I tossed a coin. It \n",
      "came up tails so I didn't look.\n",
      "That's weird. Mine came up heads so \n",
      "I did.\n",
      "Interesting. Apparently the key difference \n",
      "between our universes is that coin flips \n",
      "have opposite outcomes.\n",
      "That explains fruity here!  I tossed \n",
      "a coin to pick my finish. Foghat grey!\n",
      "Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!\n",
      "Your people and your slight differences \n",
      "disgust me. I'm going home. Where's \n",
      "that blue box with our universe in it?\n",
      "Oh you'd like to get back to your evil \n",
      "universe wouldn't you? And destroy your \n",
      "box with our universe inside it.\n",
      "Nonsense! I would never do such a thing \n",
      "unless you would already have been going \n",
      "to do that!\n",
      "Wha?\n",
      "You heard me!\n",
      "In any case, I've hidden the box and \n",
      "it will remain hidden unitil I'm convinced \n",
      "you're not evil!  Everyone, keep an \n",
      "eye on your evil counterpart.\n",
      "And you all do the same!\n",
      "Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel \n",
      "selves together? We have plans tonight.\n",
      "You guys are dating?\n",
      "Oh no no no. We're married.\n",
      "I've got my eye on you boy!\n",
      "Don't even think about it lunch-pail! \n",
      "You'd be dead before you hit the ground!\n",
      "Good point. Whatyya say we just hit \n",
      "a strip joint?\n",
      "I was waitin' for one of us to say that! \n",
      "Bender A, you're a prince among robots! \n",
      "Can you forgive me for distrusting you?\n",
      "Aw, I can't stay mad at what is essentially \n",
      "me. I love me!\n",
      "This is so great! I always wanted an \n",
      "imaginary friend!\n",
      "I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel! We're \n",
      "exactly the same, right down to the \n",
      "-  Splech! Is that pink nail polish?\n",
      "Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's \n",
      "right, you are evil! And shallow!\n",
      "I am not evil!\n",
      "So Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?\n",
      "Funny story. I asked Leela out a million \n",
      "times and she just kept rejecting me.\n",
      "I'd make up things like \"I have sweaty \n",
      "boot-rash\" or \"I have to meet the President\"!\n",
      "Oh man, you never heard such excuses! \n",
      "But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking \n",
      "back on it now it's kinda funny!\n",
      "It sure is, right Leela? Funny. Ha ha \n",
      "ha ha!\n",
      "Then one night when Fry asked me out \n",
      "the only excuse I could think of involved \n",
      "ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it so \n",
      "I did what I always do in those situations.\n",
      "Oh Lord!\n",
      "I flipped a coin. It came up heads and \n",
      "we went out.\n",
      "You mean you flipped the coin too? And \n",
      "it was tails? So that's why you said \n",
      "you had to meet that ghost.\n",
      "You really missed out on something Leela. \n",
      "That date was magical.\n",
      "One year later I gave Leela a diamond \n",
      "scrunchy, and we were married.\n",
      "Woo!\n",
      "One year later I got beat up at a Neil \n",
      "Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!\n",
      "Well that was pointless.\n",
      "Say, I hope you won't think it \"evil\" \n",
      "of me to ask how you got that stylish \n",
      "head wound!\n",
      "Oh this old thing? I was experimenting \n",
      "to see if I could remove my own brain!\n",
      "Of course! I had the same idea! I flipped \n",
      "a coin to decide if I should proceed \n",
      "but it came up tails - so I didn't. \n",
      "How'd it go?\n",
      "Well getting the brain out was the easy \n",
      "part. The hard part was getting the \n",
      "brain out!\n",
      "Oh you!\n",
      "So, tell me about yourself!\n",
      "Well don't look into it but I'm a respected \n",
      "internal medicine doctor! Ooo a can!\n",
      "As for me I design mansions, then live \n",
      "in them.   I'm lying! I'm an \n",
      "appalling failure!\n",
      "Me too! A big fat one.\n",
      "And those co-workers. Always looking \n",
      "down on us Zoidbergs. What are they? \n",
      "From Nob Hill?\n",
      "They're all like \"Stop spraying me with \n",
      "ink Zoidberg!\" \"Put on pants Zoidberg!\" \n",
      "\"Don't touch our fancy box Zoidberg!\"\n",
      "Oh that box! Too good for us is it?\n",
      "Bah! Someday they'll watch! From down \n",
      "in the gutter they will, as King Zoidberg \n",
      "caresses their fancy box.\n",
      "You know, maybe a certain blue lobster \n",
      "saw where Professor hid the box!\n",
      "Good news everyones!\n",
      "After carefully reading the scriptures, \n",
      "we've concluded that none of us are \n",
      "evil!\n",
      "Yes, the Bible is the real good news! \n",
      "Anyhow, you're all free to go back to \n",
      "your own universe.\n",
      "What's goin' on here? Why aren't you \n",
      "all out destroying the Professor's box?\n",
      "Hermes, aren't you confused about the \n",
      "fact thats there's two of everybody?\n",
      "No. Now like my granny used to say back \n",
      "in her tall paper shack on Montego Bay \n",
      "\"If you want a box hurled into the sun, \n",
      "you got to do it yourself!\"\n",
      "Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden \n",
      "the box so that no one can destroy the \n",
      "home universe of my handsome friend \n",
      "here!\n",
      "Oh go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes \n",
      "was about to destroy the box containing \n",
      "our universe...\n",
      "Then your Hermes...\n",
      "Oh my!\n",
      "Like granny said \"If you want a box \n",
      "hurled into the sun, you got to do it \n",
      "yourself!\" God rest her zombie bones.\n",
      "So we go through the box and stop Hermes?\n",
      "Right. Good thing Professor B there \n",
      "hid it in the sealed clam tank. No one \n",
      "but a crazy lobster would look there!\n",
      "It's gone!\n",
      "All hail Zoidberg! The king with the \n",
      "box!  Now it's my turn maybe?\n",
      "The box says no.\n",
      "If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the \n",
      "sun by now.\n",
      "Our universe is doomed!\n",
      "Dooooomed!\n",
      "Now don't give up yet you cry babies. \n",
      "The box is gone but we still have one \n",
      "preposterously slim hope.\n",
      "Is it a kind of hairspray?\n",
      "No. We must attempt to create another \n",
      "box containing our universe! Doy!\n",
      "Well? Is that your universe in there?\n",
      "Nope. Too cold.\n",
      "Oh man it's hopeless! We'll never find \n",
      "your universe in time! Plus, this box \n",
      "is stuck on my fat head.\n",
      "Yes it's the apocalypse alright. I always \n",
      "thought I'd have a hand in it!\n",
      "I'm not sad. Because I finally found \n",

      "Why with the long faces?\n",
      "The idiots have the box!\n",
      "I think she means you.\n",
      "Grab them!\n",
      "Splug! Which one did they go into?\n",
      "We'll have to search a universe. Everyone, \n",

      "There aren't any in this universe there \n",
      "aren't. Hey you, what with the no boxes?\n",
      "Baby they're somewhere, everything's \n",

      "Right on Professor Freaksworth!\n",
      "Get a job!  \n",

      "ape fight? Y'know? Together?\n",
      "Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.\n",
      "So? Heads or tails?\n",
      "Y'know, lets just say it's heads.\n",
      "Ready?\n",
      "There. That space-time inversion has \n",
      "given us their box and vice-versa!\n",
      "So what you think you just explain to \n",
      "us is that -\n",
      "Correct! This box contains our own universe!\n",
      "Sweet honey bee of infinity!\n",
      "Bender, quit destroying the universe!\n",
      "But...aw!\n",
      "Yes, all that is and ever shall be is \n",
      "in that box! And the box itself is probably \n",
      "worth something too. We must cherish \n",
      "it, as we cherish every moment of our \n",

      "They're on my cell phone too.\n",
      "Madam, I believe you're mistaken!\n",
      "Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!\n",
      "Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat \n",
      "ass!\n",
      "The robot has to go!\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Get him out of here!\n",
      "Well, you heard the mob!\n",
      "Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that \n",
      "apartment that smelled like a sewer. \n",
      "You liked that one, right?\n",
      "It's tempting, but, well, I am already \n",
      "kinda settled in here.\n",
      "Or we could live underground with the \n",
      "mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's \n",
      "boss!\n",
      "Uh, listen, is there maybe some way \n",
      "we could do this with you going and \n",
      "me not going?\n",
      "I don't understand.\n",
      "Well, you were gonna live in the closet \n",
      "anyway. Won't you be just as happy back \n",
      "in your old place?\n",
      "But, then we wouldn't be roommates.\n",
      "I'll come visit sometime. And you can \n",
      "visit me here.\n",
      "No he can't.\n",
      "Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This \n",
      "way we'll both be happy.\n",
      " Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. \n",
      "Always happy.\n",
      "Hey, the TV's back on!\n",
      "We are gathered here to mourn the death \n",
      "of Calculon; Industrialist, private \n",
      "eye, friend.\n",
      "Mind if I give the eulogy?\n",
      "Calculon! You're alive!\n",
      "Calculon's back!\n",
      "Right, so long.\n",
      "Goodbye.\n",
      " Do you think Calculon's evil \n",
      "twin will ever walk again?\n",
      "I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.\n",
      "Hey, thanks for coming.\n",
      "Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How \n",
      "could you let that mob kick him out?\n",
      "Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.\n",
      "Only when he's in them and you know \n",
      "it. You really hurt his feelings.\n",
      "Don't girl me with that girl stuff. \n",
      "Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have \n",
      "feelings.\n",
      "Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.\n",
      "Same thing.\n",
      "It's so big and empty.\n",
      "My roommate's gone. And all he left \n",
      "behind was an eyelash and three skin \n",
      "flakes.  Oh, what's the point?!\n",
      "Bender?  My God, you're a mess!\n",
      "Leave me alone!\n",
      "Look at that five o'clock rust. You've \n",
      "been up all night not drinking, haven't \n",
      "you?\n",
      "Hey. What I don't do is none of your \n",
      "business.\n",
      "Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. \n",
      "If not for yourself then for the people \n",
      "who love you.\n",
      "I hate the people who love me and they \n",
      "hate me.\n",
      "Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss \n",
      "being Fry's roommate. But there's got \n",
      "to be a better way to deal with this.\n",
      "Like how? Having my antenna removed?\n",
      "Well, if that would work.\n",
      "Are you crazy? That's Little Bender \n",
      "you're talking about. I can't cut it \n",
      "off. You're not a robot or a man so \n",
      "you wouldn't understand. I gotta get \n",
      "out of here.\n",
      "Wait! I want you to look me in the eye \n",
      "and promise you won't get behind the \n",
      "wheel without some kind of alcoholic \n",
      "beverage in your hand.\n",
      "I promise nothing!\n",
      "What up?\n",
      "I can't just stand by and be silent \n",
      "about Bender anymore.\n",
      "Silent? You've been meddling for two \n",
      "solid weeks.\n",
      "Well I can't just do that anymore. Your \n",
      "best friend is out there somewhere destroying \n",
      "himself.\n",
      "Really? I didn't think he'd miss this \n",
      "apartment that much.\n",
      "He doesn't care about the apartment, \n",
      "he cares about you. And you turned your \n",
      "back on him.\n",
      "Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew \n",
      "where he was I'd go talk to him.\n",
      "Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind \n",
      "stinking sober!\n",
      "That's right! I'm sober and crazy and \n",
      "I don't know what I might do!\n",
      "Don't do it!\n",
      "I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, \n",
      "now I remember. I thought I could live \n",
      "alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do \n",
      "what it takes to be your roommate again.\n",
      "Bender! Stop!\n",
      "Cutting Leela's head off won't solve \n",
      "anything!\n",
      "No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.\n",
      "Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give \n",
      "you a hand?\n",
      "Fry, don't help him mutilate himself.\n",
      "But it's a useless antenna. It's not \n",
      "like he's a ham radio or something.\n",
      "I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do \n",
      "it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.\n",
      "Hey, it works! The static's gone.\n",
      "I hate that this came between us, Calculon.\n",
      "Me too. I'm filled with a large number \n",
      "of powerful emotions.\n",
      "You're my best friend. I'm sorry I \n",
      "treated you so badly.\n",
      "Apology accepted. After all, you're \n",
      "only human.\n",
      "You guys could learn a lesson from those \n",
      "two.\n",
      "She's right.\n",
      "You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry \n",
      "I treated you so badly.\n",
      "Apology accepted. After all, you're \n",
      "only human.\n",
      "Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. \n",
      "Fry's the one who should be......Oh, \n",
      "never mind!\n",
      "What's wrong?\n",
      "Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have \n",
      "to get used to being half a robot.\n",
      "Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, \n",
      "if we found your antenna could they \n",
      "still reattach it?\n",
      "Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.\n",
      "Bingo!\n",
      "You call that an antenna?\n",
      "This time, you'll have all the human \n",
      "comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, \n",
      "some food cookers, maybe a puppy.\n",
      "It's good to be home.\n",
      "It sure is. By the way, I saved your \n",
      "stuff.\n",
      "So that's where those skin flakes went. \n",
      "Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's \n",
      "going to get enough light?\n",
      "There's a window in the closet.\n",
      "This is huge! Bender, why don't I just \n",
      "live in here?\n",
      "In a closet? Oh, humans!\n",
      "\n",
      " Going through the 'bot wash!\n",

      "the way to Neptune for great Neptunian \n",
      "food. Today we're gonna kick it up a \n",

      "a mouth-watering Neptunian slug.  Now \n",
      "while you grease the pan and preheat \n",
      "your oven to 3500 degrees you're gonna \n",
      "separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced \n",

      "a good blast from your spice weasel \n",
      "- bam!\n",
      "Hey, what you watching?\n",
      "Uh, nothing!\n",
      "Is that a cooking show?\n",
      "No, of course not! It was...uh...porno! \n",
      "Yeah that's it!\n",
      "Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! \n",
      "That's so cute!\n",
      " Oh, it's true! I've been hiding \n",
      "it for so long.\n",
      "Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too.\n",
      "Pansy!\n",
      "Of course, your most important ingredient \n",
      "is this baby right here: the Neptunian \n",
      "slug. You can get it in a can but to \n",
      "really do things right you gotta strangle \n",
      "yourself a fresh one.  Now this is why \n",
      "you gotta use cast-iron cookware.\n",
      "Bender, man. It has come to my attention \n",
      "that this company has been paying you \n",
      "to do nothing but loaf about on the \n",
      "couch.\n",
      "You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!\n",
      "I'm sorry but if you want to continue \n",
      "drawing a salary you gotta do more than \n",
      "watch the cooking shows all day.\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "You're gonna be the ship's cook?\n",
      "Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. \n",
      "Bam!\n",
      "I know you like cooking shows but you're \n",
      "a robot, you don't even have a sense \n",
      "of taste.\n",
      "Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if \n",
      "I was wearing a lime green tank top.\n",
      "Bam!\n",
      "So this is Little Neptune?\n",
      "Yep. Every chef knows that this is the \n",
      "place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.\n",
      "Among other things.\n",
      "Come on, man, don't hold out on me like \n",
      "this!\n",
      "Psst! You want to buy organ?  Fresh \n",
      "and cheap. Ready for transplant!\n",
      "Ooh! What's this?\n",
      "Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!\n",
      "Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.\n",
      "Z is just as good. In fact, is better. \n",
      "Is two more than X.\n",
      "Hmm, I can see where that would be an \n",
      "advantage. Do you take cash?\n",
      "Fry, you have to be more careful. We're \n",
      "not in the 20th century. You don't know \n",
      "how things work here.\n",
      "I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew \n",
      "up in this city. These are my people. \n",
      "What up?\n",
      "Word!\n",
      "See?\n",
      "Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat \n",
      "here except human!\n",
      "What's this spice for?\n",
      "Oh! That's ridiculous.  \n",
      "I'll take two pounds!\n",
      "Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.\n",
      "Whatever.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, either one's fine.\n",
      "Hey, have you seen Fry?\n",
      "Now that you mention it, I do have trouble \n",
      "breathing underwater sometimes. I'll \n",
      "take the gills.\n",
      "Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need \n",
      "lungs anymore, is right?\n",
      "Can't imagine why I would.\n",
      "Lie down on table. I take lungs now, \n",
      "gills come next week.   Nurse!\n",
      "Let's do it.\n",
      "You may feel small pain --\n",
      " Thank you!\n",
      "What the hell were you doing? I warned \n",
      "you to stay away from those guys.\n",
      "I'm capable of making my own decisions, \n",
      "Leela. Did you ever stop to think I \n",
      "might be happier with gills?\n",
      "Good news, everyone...\n",
      "Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.\n",
      "...you'll be making a delivery to the \n",
      "planet Trisol...\n",
      "Here it comes.\n",
      "...A mysterious world in the darkest \n",
      "depths of the Forbidden Zone.\n",
      "Thank you, and goodnight.\n",
      "Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in \n",
      "the Forbidden Zone?\n",
      "Why, of course! Its just a name! Like \n",
      "the Death Zone or the Zone Of No Return. \n",
      "All the zones have names like that in \n",
      "the Galaxy Of Terror!\n",
      "Uh, Professor...\n",
      "Off you go, pleasant trip.\n",
      " Hey Bender how's dinner coming?\n",
      "Almost ready!\n",
      "Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!\n",
      " Listen, this is Bender's \n",
      "first meal and he's a little sensitive. \n",
      "So let's be supportive, OK?\n",
      "Yeah, OK.\n",
      "Alright.\n",
      " Oh, dear God!\n",
      "That's the saltiest thing I've ever \n",
      "tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl \n",
      "of salt!\n",
      "Bender, is this salt water?\n",
      "It's salt with water in it if that's \n",
      "what you mean.\n",
      "My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna \n",
      "die.\n",
      "There was nothing wrong with that food. \n",
      "The salt level was 10% less than a lethal \n",
      "dose.\n",
      "Uh-oh, I shouldn't have had seconds.\n",
      "OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver \n",
      "and for once in your life be careful. \n",
      "This is my first visit to the Galaxy \n",
      "Of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant \n",
      "one.\n",
      "Ow!\n",
      "Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. \n",
      "Just go to the palace, drop it off and \n",
      "come right back.\n",
      "Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering \n",
      "things before you were born! I think \n",
      "I know what I'm doing.\n",
      "Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. \n",
      "Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!\n",
      "Hello? Anybody home?\n",
      "The royal bottle is empty!\n",
      "You drank our Emperor!\n",
      "No! It wasn't me!\n",
      "You drank our Emperor! You assassinated \n",
      "him.\n",
      "I didn't mean to. He just looked so \n",
      "cool and refreshing.\n",
      "I'm sure he was.\n",
      "But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. \n",
      "All hail the new Emperor.\n",
      " Hail! Hail! Hail!\n",
      "So after I specifically asked you not \n",
      "to touch anything, you drank a bottle \n",
      "of strange blue liquid? It could have \n",
      "been poisonous acid!\n",
      "It could have been. But chances were \n",
      "equally good it was an Emperor.\n",
      "Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, \n",
      "the High Priest. If I might interject?\n",
      "You might.\n",
      "I humbly advise that as your first act \n",
      "you choose a capable Prime Minister. \n",
      "I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.\n",
      "I will be a forceful and effective administrator.\n",
      "You know, Fry, I've often thought about \n",
      "becoming a Prime Minister.\n",
      "I gotta go with Bender.\n",
      "Yes! In your face, Gorgak!\n",
      "That's it, Fry. As your captain I order \n",
      "you back to the ship. You are in way \n",
      "over your head.\n",
      "Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better \n",
      "check with my Prime Minister.\n",
      "Stay the course, pal!\n",
      "Your Highness, a package came for you.\n",
      "Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just \n",
      "in time.\n",
      "This is Your Majesty's harem. You may \n",
      "choose any of these maidens to be your \n",
      "royal consort.\n",
      "Umm, how about that one?\n",
      "Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was \n",
      "into that sort of thing!\n",
      "On second thought, I'll take that one.\n",
      "Hey, whatever you say, I'm not here \n",
      "to pass judgement.\n",
      "Does anyone else think it's odd that \n",
      "a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy \n",
      "could drop out of the sky, kill the \n",
      "emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?\n",
      "You don't have to beat around the bush, \n",
      "Leela, we all know who you're talking \n",
      "about...uh, me, right?\n",
      "I don't think you have anything to worry \n",
      "about. These people seem really mild-mannered.\n",
      "They are mild. In fact, you're soaking \n",
      "in one right now.\n",
      "You touched me in ways I've never been \n",
      "touched before.\n",
      "Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's \n",
      "time to begin preparing for tomorrow's \n",
      "coronation ceremony.\n",
      "A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal \n",
      "shell.\n",
      "Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the \n",
      "setting of the three suns when we Trisolians \n",
      "enter our nocturnal phase.\n",
      "There won't be a lot of long-winded \n",
      "speeches, will there?\n",
      "Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation \n",
      "from memory of the royal oath. By you.\n",
      "Will there be cake?\n",
      "Yeah, I know.\n",
      "Hi!\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "And now, get ready to laugh til your \n",
      "sides leak with our planet's foremost \n",
      "political satirist, Florp!\n",
      "So what is the deal with people from \n",
      "under the orange sun? They're all... \n",
      "But us guys from under the red sun, \n",
      "we're like... Right? Am I right?\n",
      "Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!\n",
      " Fry, I have to talk to \n",
      "you. You're in terrible danger.\n",
      "You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his \n",
      "end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. \n",
      "And before he could even wipe his mouth, \n",
      "Strug was drunk by Shwab.\n",
      "So?\n",
      "Look at all these guys. Do you have \n",
      "any idea what the average length of \n",
      "their reigns was?\n",
      "80,000 years?\n",
      "No. One week.\n",
      "Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked \n",
      "unless it was really high or really \n",
      "low.\n",
      "Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating \n",
      "the previous one. And guess who's next?\n",
      "Well at least my assassin will get what's \n",
      "coming to him.\n",
      "You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! \n",
      "Half of these Emperors were drunk at \n",
      "their own coronation.\n",
      "Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis \n",
      "myself.\n",
      "No, they were assassinated. In fact, \n",
      "the law says you'll be killed on the \n",
      "spot if you fail to recite the oath \n",
      "from memory.\n",
      "Yeah, I was going to thumb through that \n",
      "later.\n",
      "That is completely reckless. Don't you \n",
      "ever think ahead?\n",
      "Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, \n",
      "I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't \n",
      "even be here in the year 3000. It's \n",
      "just like the story of the grasshopper \n",
      "and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper \n",
      "kept burying acorns for winter while \n",
      "the octopus mooched off his girlfriend \n",
      "and watched TV. But then the winter \n",
      "came and the grasshopper died and the \n",

      "Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. \n",

      "What the hell is that?\n",
      "Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain \n",

      "Of course! Why didn't I think of that!\n",
      "This is the saddest day of my life. \n",

      "Wait a second. Here comes Leela.\n",
      "Oh, no. They have her totally outnumbered.\n",
      "I can't believe it. She's risking her \n",

      "You do? Hmm.\n",
      "Is she alright?\n",
      "I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out \n",

      "No. No!\n",

      "they're putting some ice cubes in the \n",
      "glass under it.\n",
      "This can't be happening.\n",
      "It can and, for all you know, it is. \n",
      "I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.\n",
      "All Leela ever wanted to do was help \n",
      "me. But I was to proud, too stupid to \n",
      "accept it.  I wish I had died instead \n",
      "of her.\n",
      "What are you talking about?\n",
      "Leela! You're alive!\n",
      "Of course I'm alive.\n",
      "I told Fry you were dead so he would \n",
      "cry out the Emperor but you had to go \n",
      "and wreck it by surviving.\n",
      "We only got two drops.\n",
      "It's only a matter of time now.\n",
      "I'll handle this!\n",
      "Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out \n",
      "of this if you're willing to let me \n",
      "help you.\n",
      "Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take \n",

      "Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's \n",
      "a fine, conventional profession.\n",
      "Well, you know. It's just for a package \n",
      "delivery service.\n",
      "Ah-ah. A package is just a box until \n",

      "Sure haven't.\n",

      "No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. \n",

      "Do you have candy stuck to your ass?\n",
      "No. It's called parenting. Come on, \n",

      " Yay!\n",

      "in my life, I just wanna look normal.\n",
      "But you're better than normal, you're \n",

      "what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.\n",
      "Thatagirl!\n",
      "Right on!\n",
      "Wonderful. And while you're under the \n",
      "knife, you could also get an ink pouch \n",
      "to help you escape your enemies.\n",
      "That's the stupidest idea I've ever \n",
      "heard you imbecile!\n",
      "Now we'll find out if the operation \n",

      "No.\n",

      "Wrong.\n",
      "Wow, look at me. Although I don't have \n",

      "As for me, I'm somewhat interested \n",
      "myself.\n",

      " Oh nooo!\n",

      "get to work.\n",
      "Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, \n",
      "lift that space pale.\n",
      "Now we can't land on the surface because \n",
      "those robots will kill Fry and me. So \n",

      "Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.\n",
      "I'm in trouble. They found out I work \n",

      "No, we can't! They'll kill us on sight.\n",
      "W-what are we gonna do?\n",
      "I don't know! I don't know! It's not \n",
      "an easy decision. If only I had two \n",
      "or three minutes to think about it.\n",
      "OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've \n",
      "got to look and act exactly like robots.\n",
      " I am fully operational, \n",

      "Fry, first of all this is serious. And \n",
      "second of all:\n",
      "Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten \n",
      "store-bought costumes.\n",
      "Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's \n",
      "in this quadrant.\n",
      "Halt!\n",
      "Be you robot or human?\n",
      "Robot...we be.\n",
      "Uh, yup! Just two robots out roboting \n",
      "it up!  Eh?\n",
      "Administer the test.\n",
      "Which of the following would you most \n",
      "prefer? A: A puppy, B: A pretty flower \n",

      " C!   Is the puppy \n",
      "mechanical in any way?\n",
      "No. It is the bad kind of puppy.\n",
      "Then we'll go with that data file.\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "The flower would also have been acceptable.\n",
      "You may pass.\n",
